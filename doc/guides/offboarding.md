# Offboarding

This document is a checklist of things to do when a Collaborator becomes
Emeritus or leaves the project.

* Remove the Collaborator from the @nodejs/collaborators team.
* Open a fast-track pull request to move the Collaborator to Collaborator
  Emeriti in README.md.
* Determine what GitHub teams the Collaborator belongs to. In consultation with
  the Collaborator, determine which of those teams they should be removed from.
  * Some teams may also require a pull request to remove the Collaborator from
    a team listing. For example, if someone is removed from @nodejs/build,
    they should also be removed from the Build WG README.md file in the
    <https://github.com/nodejs/build> repository.
