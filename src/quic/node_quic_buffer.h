// When data is sent over QUIC, we are required to retain it in memory
// until we receive an acknowledgement that it has been successfully
// acknowledged. The QuicBuffer object is what we use to handle that
// and track until it is acknowledged. To understand the QuicBuffer
// object itself, it is important to understand how ngtcp2 and nghttp3
// handle data that is given to it to serialize into QUIC packets.
//
// An individual QUIC packet may contain multiple QUIC frames. Whenever
// we create a QUIC packet, we really have no idea what frames are going
// to be encoded or how much buffered handshake or stream data is going
// to be included within that QuicPacket. If there is buffered data
// available for a stream, we provide an array of pointers to that data
// and an indication about how much data is available, then we leave it
// entirely up to ngtcp2 and nghttp3 to determine how much of the data
// to encode into the QUIC packet. It is only *after* the QUIC packet
// is encoded that we can know how much was actually written.
//
// Once written to a QUIC Packet, we have to keep the data in memory
// until an acknowledgement is received. In QUIC, acknowledgements are
// received per range of packets.
//
// QuicBuffer is complicated because it needs to be able to accomplish
// three things: (a) buffering uv_buf_t instances passed down from
// JavaScript without memcpy and keeping track of the Write callback
// associated with each, (b) tracking what data has already been
// encoded in a QUIC packet and what data is remaining to be read, and
// (c) tracking which data has been acknowledged and which hasn't.
// QuicBuffer is further complicated by design quirks and limitations
// of the StreamBase API and how it interacts with the JavaScript side.
//
// QuicBuffer is essentially a linked list of QuicBufferChunk instances.
// A single QuicBufferChunk wraps a single non-zero-length uv_buf_t.
// When the QuicBufferChunk is created, we capture the total length
// of the buffer and the total number of bytes remaining to be sent.
// Initially, these numbers are identical.
//
// When data is encoded into a QuicPacket, we advance the QuicBufferChunk's
// remaining-to-be-read by the number of bytes actually encoded. If there
// are no more bytes remaining to be encoded, we move to the next chunk
// in the linked list.
//
// When an acknowledgement is received, we decrement the QuicBufferChunk's
// length by the number of acknowledged bytes. Once the unacknowledged
// length reaches 0, we invoke the callback function associated with the
// QuicBufferChunk (if any).
//
// QuicStream is a StreamBase implementation. For every DoWrite call,
// it receives one or more uv_buf_t instances in a single batch associated
// with a single write callback. For each uv_buf_t DoWrite gets, a
// corresponding QuicBufferChunk is added to the QuicBuffer, with the
// callback associated with the final chunk added to the list.


// A QuicBufferChunk contains the actual buffered data
// along with a callback to be called when the data has
// been consumed.
//
// Any given chunk as a remaining-to-be-acknowledged length (length()) and a
// remaining-to-be-read-length (remaining()). The former tracks the number
// of bytes that have yet to be acknowledged by the QUIC peer. Once the
// remaining-to-be-acknowledged length reaches zero, the done callback
// associated with the QuicBufferChunk can be called and the QuicBufferChunk
// can be discarded. The remaining-to-be-read length is adjusted as data is
// serialized into QUIC packets and sent.
// The remaining-to-be-acknowledged length is adjusted using consume(),
// while the remaining-to-be-ead length is adjusted using seek().
